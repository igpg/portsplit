- Proper logging, both to logfile (first priority) and syslog (second priority)
- Define meaningful internal return codes for better error handling
- Manage UDP
- External files with patterns to be matched
- Pattern regex
- Add support for management of libevent, and keep the old select() and give the choice at compile-time
