# Roadmap to version 1.0.0
- Make sure output messages are relevant, give enough info, etc.
- Have the Makefiles work properly: include man/ subdir when manpage is written, have configure.ac fetch git tag to PACKAGE_VERSION
- Tag version 1.0.0 with git when it's ok.
- PGP-sign commits

# Going further
- Daemonization
- Proper logging, both to logfile (first priority) and syslog (second priority)
- Define meaningful internal return codes for better error handling
- Manage UDP
- External files with patterns to be matched
- Pattern regex
- Add support for management of libevent, and keep the old select() and give the choice at compile-time
